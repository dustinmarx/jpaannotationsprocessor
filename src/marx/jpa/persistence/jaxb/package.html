This package contains JAXB-generated classes that were generated
from the JPA XML Schema for object-relational mapping and are used
to write in-source JPA annotation information out to the appropriate
XML format in generation of the <code>orm.xml</code> file.

<h2>Disclaimer / Caution</h2>

All code in this package was generated with the <code>xjc</code>
JAXB binding compiler that comes with Java SE 6.  This file with
package information is the only file not generated automatically.
