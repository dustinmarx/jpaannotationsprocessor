<body bgcolor="white">

<p>The package <code>marx.apt.jpa</code> includes the code for
processing JPA in-source annotations and writing out an
equivalent <code>orm.xml</code> object-relational mapping file.
This code accompanies the article "Better JPA, Better JAXB, and
Better Annotations Processing" published on Oracle Technology
Network (OTN).</p>

<p>The JPA annotations processed by code in this package are only
a subset of the available JPA annotations.  This package's code
essentially only processes annotations used in the same JPA-based
code in the <code>dustin.jpa</code> package.</p>

<h2>Disclaimer / Caution</h2>

This code is not production ready. This code is intended solely
as <strong>proof of concept</strong> code and to illustrate
concepts discussed in the previously referenced OTN article.
Any production code would need to be enhanced to support additional
JPA annotations, would need to be refactored, and would need
more thorough testing.
