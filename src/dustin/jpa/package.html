This package contains the source code of JPA-based entity classes and
their client classes used for simple tests.  The JPA-based entities in
this package are decorated with JPA annotations, but are also used in
testing of an overriding orm.xml file.  This package is part of a
set of <strong>proof of concept</strong> code included with the OTN
article <em>Better JPA, Better JAXB, and Better Annotations Processing
with Java SE 6</em>.

<h2>Disclaimer / Caution</h2>

The code in this package is for article illustrative and proof of
concept illustrative purposes only and is not intended for production
use.  Any production use would require support for a much greater set
of JPA annotations as well as more thorough testing and some code
refactoring.
